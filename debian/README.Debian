Bazel for Debian
---------------

Please note that Bazel does not currently support builds on 32-bit processors.
This support may be added in the future.

This build system is not currently considered stable in Debian. Furthermore,
this is only a bootstrap version to allow required initial builds. Please
report any bugs or unusual indications!
